  Being the largest contributor, lets take a deeper look at {{highest_level_by_avg}}.
  When {{dim1}} is {{dim1_top_level}},{{dim2_top_level_percent_cont}}% percentage is contrubuted by observations where
   {{dim2}} is {{dim2_top_level}},
  where as the contribution in the overall dataset is {{dim2_top_level_overall_per}}%.

  Also, {{dim2_top_diff_percent_cont}}%  is contributed by observations where {{dim2}} is {{dim2_top_diff_level}},
  where as the contribution of the same is {{dim2_top_diff_overall_per}}% in the overall dataset.

  {{dim3_top_level}} in {{dim3}} contribute to {{dim3_top_level_percent_cont}}% of  observations for {{dim1_top_level}} in
  {{dim1}}, where as the contribution is {{dim3_top_level_overall_per}}% in the overall dataset.

  Also, {{dim3_top_diff_percent_cont}}%  is contrubuted by observations where {{dim3}} is {{dim3_top_diff_level}}, where as the contribution of the
  same is {{dim2_top_diff_overall_per}}% in the overall dataset.
